# Interview Project: Division Calculator

This project is designed for evaluating a candidate's knowledge in Java programming and testing. 

It involves implementing a simple division calculator with logging and exception handling. 

The project consists of two classes: DivisionExecution and DivisionResult. Candidates will be asked to explain the code, optimize it, handle errors, and write tests.

## Division Calculator
This project implements a simple division calculator in Java. It consists of two classes:
1. **DivisionExecution**: This class handles the main logic of the division calculator, including user input and division operation.
2. **DivisionResult**: This class represents the result of a division operation, encapsulating the quotient and remainder.

The project uses Lombok for reducing boilerplate code and SLF4J for logging.
